# Perks

Faster Prayers              10 points
You can ignore the -2 penalty to petition rolls when
attempting one-second prayers.

Repeated Petitioner         5 points/level
Each level of this trait allows you to, once per day,
ignore the penalties to petition and reaction rolls for
multiple successful general and specific prayers. It is rec-
ommended that the GM allow no more than four levels
for starting adventurers.

Practiced Petitioner        10 points
As noted in Divine Favor (p. 6), a learned prayer requires
one second of prayer (a Concentrate maneuver) before it can
be used. You can invoke yours as a free action, once per turn!
This has no effect on general or specific prayers; to speed those
up, take Faster Prayers (Pyramid #3/36, p. 8).

Dual Prayers                20 points
Prerequisite: Divine Favor 12 and Faster Prayers.

You can have Divine Favor and a learned prayer, or two different
learned prayers, active at the same time.
Statistics: Compartmentalized Mind (Limited, Divine Favor
Only, -5%; No additional maneuvers, -35%; No Mental Separa-
tion, -20%) [20].

Ordained
2 points/level
As clerics can become Beatified (Pyramid #3/36, p. 10) to
gain a closer contact with their deity, Saints can join the ranks
of the organized church, and gain access to standard clerical
spells. They must purchase Power Investiture (Holy, Unholy,
or any of the variant types presented in Clerics) for 2
points/level as an alternative ability to their
Power Investiture (Divine Favor).
Advantages: Add Power Investiture (Holy,
Unholy, or any other variant type) [2/level] as
an alternate ability (see above).
